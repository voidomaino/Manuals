Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify  complex diagrams.  The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation  catch up with development.

> Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.

Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly. But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.

Mermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily  modifiable diagrams, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).
